      <p>Often referred to as a 'war', course registration process of Seoul

      <p>In this process, students sometimes accidentally reload the website,
      where the system immediately returns error message and forces user to log-in
      again. (I suspect this is to prvent users from using macro, but no one
      knows..) This is disastrous, since logging in makes users waste their times
      a lot in such a urgent situation.<br><br></p>

      <p>Have you ever wished a robot to send romantic messages to the other on
      behalf of yourself? Having a conversation in a romantic relationship is
      often difficult. Sometimes we ask our friends for help, but such help is
      limited.<br><br></p>

      <p>In this project, we assumed that an AI agent in chat settings became so
      smart that it perfectly analyzes the counterpart's emotion and suggests
      responses in a chat setting. Along with a prototype app LOVEGORITHM that
      helps such a romantic relationship, we designed and developed an LOVEGORITHM
      online user community that illustrates possible feedback and behaviors of

      <p>Due to the irreversible characteristics and disastrous effects of
      Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), a precise diagnosis of the symptoms
      is extremely important. Yet, paper-based Amsler Grid, the most prevalent
      testing method, is highly limited in that it requires the indirect report of
      patients and quantitative reporting is difficult.<br><br></p>

      <p>In this project, I designed and developed a touch-based Amsler grid web
      app. As such, I aimed to support patients' exact report of their regions of
      symptoms.<br><br></p>

      <p>What made this project special to me is that, I made a LaTeX template for
      writing this paper! I found that my friends preparing for their thesis
      always felt it difficult to produce a thesis format, since our department
      only gave us a 'scanned' version of template, not a real document. Thus, I
      generated a template which can be found <a
      href='https://github.com/donghoon-io/SNUECE-BS-thesis'>here</a> (this
      template was built upon previous Ph.D. dissertation template under
      license)<br><br></p>

      <p>This study was conducted for my B.S. thesis, and later published in HCI
      Korea 2022.</p>

      computer-based intervention for computer vision syndrome to set design
      guidelines based on pros/cons of each interface element.<br><br></p>

      <p>In this project, I developed LiquidEye: an intervention application

      <p>It is a prevalent behavior of having a chat with strangers in online
      settings where people can easily gather. Yet, people often find it difficult
      to initiate and maintain conversation due to the lack of information about
      strangers.<br><br></p>

      <p>Hence, we aimed to facilitate conversation between the strangers with the
      use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and present BlahBlahBot, an
      ML-infused chatbot that moderates conversation between strangers with
      personalized topics. Based on social media posts, BlahBlahBot supports the
      conversation by suggesting topics that are likely to be of mutual interest
      between users.<br><br></p>

      <p>A user study with three groups (control, random topic chatbot, and
      BlahBlahBot; N=18) found the feasibility of BlahBlahBot in increasing both
      conversation quality and closeness to the partner, along with the factors
      that led to such increases from the user interview. Overall, our preliminary
      results imply that an ML-infused conversational agent can be effective for
      augmenting a dyadic conversation.<br><br></p>

      <p>According to a recent survey conducted by American Psychological
      Association [1], academic stress is cited as the number one stressor in
      students' daily life. This issue is specifically considered serious in South
      Korea, where half of Korean teenagers experienced a thought of suicidal and
      academic stress is reported as a top-ranked attribute to such phenomenon
      [2].<br><br></p>

      <p>This, however, cannot be solely dealt with reducing academic affair.
      Since such academic phenomenon is multi-faceted with lots of stakeholders
      involved (e.g., homeroom teacher, parents, and friends), we should not
      naÃ¯vely understand the issue. For example, high schools often focus on
      increasing the number of students entering so-called 'prestigious
      universities.' However, by solely focusing on the name of university rather
      than a major, this often undermines the agency of students' decision on
      their future career, and leading students to suffer from subsidious academic
      stresses as well as a stress on the study itself.<br><br></p>

      <p>Since the academic curriculum drastically changes over time and
      policy-makers and relatively older people cannot easily understand such a
      situation, we aimed to show how difficult it is for high school students to
      'survive' under such factors that often lead to academic stresses. By having
      users choose a choice in each crossroad of choices and differentiating the
      following storieline, we, though indirectly, let them feel how stressed high
      school students would be in the midst of a choice.<br><br></p>

      <p>In this project, we designed an application for supporting those who
      study abroad, but came back due to COVID-19. Since they often suffer from
      lack of sleep due to the time difference, we aimed to support them with
      managing their health, at the same time not undermining their classworks. In
      order to precisely understand their needs, we conducted extensive user
      interview sessions, YouTube v-logger observation study, diary study, and web
      survey.<br><br></p>

      <p>As a result, we designed 'å¤œ-planet', an application that supports
      students under such circumstances. 'å¤œ' is a Chinese character for 'night',
      and 'å¤œ-planet' stands for 'nocturnal.'<br><br></p>

      <p>At the end of my sophomore year, I read one CHI paper by chance:
      <b>'Blocks4All: overcoming accessibility barriers to
          blocks programming for children with visual impairments.'</b> Written by Milne and her colleagues, this paper
          explores the methods of overcoming accessibility issues in existing block-based programming tools. I was super
          intrigued by how HCI researchers try to understand user groups and reflect design implications into an artifact.<br><br></p>
      <p>Surprisingly, at that moment my supervisor asked if I'm willing to lead a
      project for developing an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication)
      application.
          Definitely I said yes, because I found it really difficult to take part in any research project as an undergrad without any
          previous research experience then. From then, I spent almost every night developing an iOS app, while simultaneously conducting
          user studies, reading relevant papers, and even designing! Literally everything was new: from being funded for a research to getting an
          approval from IRB for the evaluation! Fortunately, at the moment when I finished my research, we were almost at the deadline
          of <b>CHI 2020</b> and submitted our work there, and got accepted with an <b>Honorable Mention Award</b>.<br><br></p>
      <p>To summarize our paper briefly, we tried not to restrict a stakeholder of
      AAC to only a child, but also viewed their caregivers
          very important in the process of child's communication. Based on this research context, we aimed to develop a system that helps them collaborate to
          drive the best strategies on child's communication. As a result, we developed <b>Talkingboogie, a mobile AAC system for children
          with developmental disabilities</b>.</p>

      <p>I believe that one's favourite set of music in a specific period
      represents own emotion at that period. To prove this, I listed all my
      favourite songs by each semester. Then, I analyzed the emotion of each song
      using <a href='https://cyanite.ai'>Cyanite</a>, and I visualized the results
      with <a href='https://d3js.org'>D3.js</a>.<br><br></p>

      <p>Well, I was super shocked by the result. For my depressing time, I used
      to listen to melancholic songs. For my highest period, my playlist was full
      of happy and energetic songs. Why don't you try with your own
      playlist?<br><br></p>

      <p>I personally don't prefer to believe things that haven't been proved yet.
      But some posts in social networking services make people believe fake or
      unproven news to be correct, and some even try to convey these for their
      political purposes.<br><br></p>

      <p>In this project, I aimed to provide examples of some 'controversial'
      information that emerged during the COVID-19 situation. Then, I tried to let
      readers decide on it. Well, this project was tough because COVID-19 was a
      'relatively new' phenomenon then, and it lacked scientifically proven
      information. However, I'm pretty fascinated with how 'seemingly ridiculous'
      information is spread throughout people and later considered to be
      true.<br><br></p>

      <p>I've been working as an iOS developer in a local micro-mobility sharing
      startup for about 2 years. As working in a tech company, I got to know

      that understanding possible users is extremely important for the success of
      service and business.<br><br></p>

      <p>Thus, I decided to take 'Digital Ethnography' class, where students
      choose one topic they want to deal with and explore user groups to better

      understand the topic. With the topic of <b>understanding why users hesitate
      riding a sharing mobility device and discuss solutions using
      ethnography</b>,

      I ran a couple of observation and interview studies with college students
      (N=6).<br><br></p>

      <p>Even though I could run the user observation study neither for a long
      term nor with a large number (COVID-19),

      it was really interesting to understand how HCI researchers explore users
      with qualitative methodologies in the real-world context.<br><br></p>

      <p>Please kindly understand that the paper was written in Korean
      language.</p>

      <p>It was extremely difficult for me to keep track of the courses I've taken
      during the undergraduate study. I'm surprised that many other friends also
      fased similar problem.<br><br></p>

      <p>To make this process hassle-free, I made an iOS app called <b>ECE
      grad</b>. Using this application, undergrads in ECE department may easily
      track their previously taken courses. Plus, this also shows how many credits
      they should additionally take. Plus, this system automatically visualizes
      the history and show some cheer-up messages for inducing students to take
      courses and keep track of their course history.<br><br></p>

      <p>However, some of my friends suggested that it was a bit time-consuming to
      manually add courses into the system. Based on this feedback, in order to
      facilitate the process of entering their previous courses, I added a
      <b>crawling function</b> that automatically crawls the relevant data within
      SNU mypage, by simply entering their ID and password.</p>

      design the website (based upon the previously designed template) and added
      up the lab members' profile.<br><br></p>

      <p>It was a great experience to contribute to the lab with my skillsets!</p>
