abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive chronic disease that is led by damage in the macula. Due to its irreversible characteristics and disastrous effects on the patients, a precise diagnosis of the symptoms is extremely important. Yet, paperbased Amsler Grid, which is known as the most prevalent testing method, is highly limited in that it requires the indirect report of patients and quantitative reporting is difficult. To address this, I propose AmslerTouch, a touch-based Amslertesting web app that supports patients to self-report AMD symptoms. Based on the heuristic evaluation for identifying enhancements, I also discuss possible enhancements of my proposed system.
